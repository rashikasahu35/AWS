# Python Application on AWS EC2 using AWS DevOps Services
A fully automated CI/CD pipeline was implemented to deploy a Python application on an AWS EC2 instance using AWS DevOps services such as CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline. The pipeline includes building a Docker image, securely managing credentials, and deploying the application as a container.

### Key Components
- **AWS EC2:** Hosting the Python application.
- **AWS CodePipeline:** Automating the CI/CD process.
- **AWS CodeBuild:** Building the Docker image.
- **AWS CodeDeploy:** Deploying the Docker container to the EC2 instance.
- **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store:** Securely storing Docker Hub credentials.
- **Docker:** Containerizing the Python application.

## Deployment Steps
Follow these steps to deploy this architecture on AWS:

### Step 1: Set Up an EC2 Instance
- Provision an EC2 instance with required configurations.
- Install Docker and necessary dependencies.
- Configure security groups to allow necessary access.

### Step 2: Store Credentials Securely
- Add Docker Hub credentials (username and password) to AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.

### Step 3: Push Code to Repository
- Upload the Python application and itsÂ Dockerfile to a Git repository (AWS CodeCommit/GitHub).

### Step 4: Build Application with CodeBuild
- Configure a buildspec.yml file for CodeBuild to build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub.

### Step 5: Set Up CodeDeploy
- Create a CodeDeploy application and deployment group for EC2 instances.
- Use appspec.yml and deployment scripts to manage Docker container deployment.

### Step 6: Automate Deployment with CodePipeline
- Automate the CI/CD process by integrating CodeBuild and CodeDeploy into AWS CodePipeline.
- Ensure automated triggers and rollback mechanisms are configured.
