# AWS VPC Peering
This project demonstrates how to set up VPC peering between three different VPCs (Finance, Marketing, and Developer) to enable seamless communication between EC2 instances across these VPCs.

### Key Components:
- **Amazon VPC:** Three isolated VPCs (Finance, Marketing, Developer) for different departments.
- **Amazon EC2:** Virtual machines deployed in each VPC.
- **VPC Peering Connections:** To enable private network communication between VPCs.
- **Route Tables & Security Groups:** Configured to allow traffic flow between peered VPCs.

## Steps:
### Step 1: Create VPCs and Deploy EC2 Instances
- Create three separate VPCs (Finance, Marketing, Developer) in AWS.
- Allocate subnets, route tables, and internet gateways as needed.
- Deploy an EC2 instance in each VPC for testing connectivity.

### Step 2: Establish VPC Peering Connections
- Create a peering connection between each pair of VPCs.

### Step 3: Update Route Tables
- Modify the route tables for each VPC to enable routing between the peered VPCs.
- Add routes for the peered VPCs' CIDR blocks.

### Step 4: Configure Security Groups
- Modify the security groups attached to EC2 instances.
- Allow inbound and outbound traffic from the peered VPCsâ€™ CIDR blocks.

### Step 5: Validate Connection
1. Verify connectivity between instances across different VPCs.

## Conclusion
By setting up VPC peering, we have enabled private network communication between VPCs while maintaining security and performance. This setup is useful for multi-department architectures where services need to communicate securely within an AWS environment.
